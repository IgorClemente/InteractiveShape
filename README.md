# Interactive shapes - iOS demo
A quick demo made for [this Dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1950331-Interactive-shapes-iOS-demo).

It basically just draws two simple bezier curves, something like this:

The "tip" is placed based on pan with fixed control points, and control points of the top and bottom left corners are stretched a bit according to pan's translation along Y axis to make a nicer curve.
